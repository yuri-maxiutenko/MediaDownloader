The Media Downloader Project
====================
Just a small user-friendly UI wrapper (C#/WPF, .NET Core) over the great video downloading command-line utility [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) which allows to download videos in different quality from various internet resources (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, you name it). Downloading playlists is supported too.

## Main Features

**Media Downloader** is capable of downloading almost any video from all major providers (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, etc.). Just give it a link and voil√†! Links to playlists are fine too.

Currently the application supports the following download formats:

* best video quality;
* best video quality available via direct link;
* audio only.

Also, **Media Downloader** supports download history and stores the list of recently used folders.

Comes with an installer, which includes everything necessary: the application itself, **youtube-dl** and the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) converter.

The application is installed to current user's AppData folder and doesn't require administrator's permissions.

Curently **Media Downloader** is localized to English and Russian. The application language is automatically selected depending on current Windows locale.

## Requirements

Starting from version **2.1**, the application uses **[.NET 5 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)**. But you shouldn't need to install it, as Media Downloader is provided as **[a self-contained application](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/app-trimming-in-net-5/)**.

Also, **youtube-dl** requires **[Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555)**.
