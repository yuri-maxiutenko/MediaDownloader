The Media Downloader Project
====================
Just a small user-friendly C#/WPF UI wrapper over the great video downloading command-line utility [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) which allows to download videos in different quality from various internet resources (YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, you name it).

Comes with an installer, which includes everything necessary: the wrapper itself, **youtube-dl** and the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) converter.

The application supports download history and stores the list of recently used folders.
